## Notify Project Tutorials

Notify uses rust for the backend api and typescript with react for the frontend.

If you haven't already please visit the readme for the Backend and Frontend components to get your environment setup for development.

These tutorials are designed to introduce you to the notify code base, not to teach you how to use rust, react, or typescript.

If you are unfamiliar with these technologies please take some time to learn them before continuing.

If you're learning rust we recommend the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
If you're learning react we recommend the [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and

You might also want to consider these typescript resources:

- [typescript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [total typescript beginners typescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript) - this is a video based course, if that suits your learning style
- [Hands on react typescript](https://handsonreact.com/docs/react-typescript)

The tutorials are broken up into chunks that build on one another, so we recommend starting with the first one and working your way through them in order.

This code base shares a lot of common ancestry with [open-mSupply](https://github.com/openmsupply/open-msupply) our medical warehouse management system. We expect this tutorial to be useful for people wanting to contribute to that project as well.
